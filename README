One Helluva Music Manager:

I am an easy and simple tool to play your music through CLI.
I am basically a wrapper over your shell. Certain commands I will recognize to manipulate your music.
Anything I do not know I will throw at your favorite shell!

COMMANDS:
	play [SONG]
		if no argument is provided I play all contents of the directory recursively
	pause
	(n)ext|(b)ack
	(u)p|(d)own
	add [SONG]
		play afterwards for an on the fly playorder
	info
	stop
	quit
Use shell commands to navigate your filesystem and create directories for playlists.
