One Helluva Music Manager:

I am an easy and simple tool to play your music through CLI.
I am basically a wrapper over your shell. Certain commands I will recognize to manipulate your music.
Anything I do not know I will throw at your favorite shell!

COMMANDS:
	play [SONG]
		if no argument is provided I play all contents of the directory recursively
	(p)ause
	(n)ext|(b)ack [NUM]
	(u)p|(d)own
	add [SONG]
		play afterwards for an on the fly playorder
	info
	stop
	(q)uit
	(h)elp
	shuffle [on|off]
		or (s) to toggle
	repeat [none||all|num] [NUM]
	extract [soft|hard] [D_SRC]
	mtp [ARGS]
	backup
	(l)ist
	(pos)ition
		in my playlist, what song am I at
	(go)to [NUM]

Use shell commands to navigate your filesystem and create directories for playlists.
